# Chat Server

In this file I have completed a terminal version and GUI version of the chatroom
that can communicate with multiple clients by a server. The GUI implementation can
be found in the gui_version file and the terminal implementation can be found in
the terminal_version file.

In the terminal file I have implemented a pydoc for the server.py and client.py as
I use an external module called term colour. I had to separate the pydoc from the
original files however it will function as normal.

The only external module I have imported is the termcolor library that allows
the change of colours on the command line as well as more dynamic display such
as word blinking. This is inbuilt with most python modules however it is available
to install online for free.
